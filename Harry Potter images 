"""
The following code is representative of a scenario where a developer needs to write 
extensive documentation and code. While this particular script is focused on managing and displaying images,
similar approaches can be taken with other types of projects. 

Keep in mind that in real-world scenarios, the goal should always be clarity, maintainability, 
and functionality rather than simply increasing the line count of your code.
However, there are times when extensive documentation, examples, and comments 
can help with teaching or understanding more complex concepts.

This example script is an educational tool and may not be practical for all uses, 
but it illustrates how Python can be used to manage image files, display them, and 
how to write very detailed, commented code.

The true challenge for a developer is finding the right balance between 
documentation and clean, efficient coding practices.
